## Development Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Proceed with Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a rule
- Create tests first, based on expected inputs and outputs
- Write only the tests; do not write any implementation code
- Run the tests and confirm they fail
- Commit once you have confirmed the tests are correct
- Then proceed with the implementation that makes the tests pass
- Do not modify the tests during implementation; continue refining the code
- Repeat until all tests pass
